# SheetBinding Bug

A repository that shows a runtime warning when using `BindingState` in a sheet,
using the new `Composable Architecture` navigation tools from the `prerelease/1.0` branch.

## To show the warning

1. Run the app in simulator
2. Click the `Add Todo` button.
3. Add a new todo and click the `Save` button.

## Note

The warning does not occur when you do not add a `Todo` / dismiss the sheet.
